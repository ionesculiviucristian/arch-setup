## About this project

This is a personal Arch Linux setup designed to streamline the installation and configuration of both general-purpose and workstation-specific environments. It provides a modular, reproducible, and well-documented system tailored for daily productivity, development, and media work.

The repository includes:

- Automated setup scripts for clean installs  
- Curated lists of essential Arch, AUR, and external packages  
- Workstation-specific configurations (e.g., B450 I AORUS PRO WIFI)  
- Theming, aliases, and plugin selections for browsers and terminals  
- Support for private dotfiles and secure secrets setup  

This project serves as both a starting point and a living reference for managing and maintaining a reliable Arch-based workstation.

## Installation

./install.sh

# Post reboot setup
./setups/base/post_reboot.sh

# Setup B450 I AORUS PRO WIFI workstation
